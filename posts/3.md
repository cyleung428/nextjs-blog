Recently, I used redux together with epic middleware for state management in redux.

### Redux

Traditionally, React developers use redux for state management as it is difficult to transport data between multipute components.

### RxJS

RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by Array#extras (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.

### Epic Middleware

With the advantage of reactive-programming, we can apply rxjs to redux by implementing epic middleware on redux.

<pre>
<code>
import { ajax } from 'rxjs/ajax';

// action creators
const fetchUser = username => ({ type: FETCH_USER, payload: username });
const fetchUserFulfilled = payload => ({ type: FETCH_USER_FULFILLED, payload });

// epic
const fetchUserEpic = action$ => action$.pipe(
  ofType(FETCH_USER),
  mergeMap(action =>
    ajax.getJSON(`https://api.github.com/users/${action.payload}`).pipe(
      map(response => fetchUserFulfilled(response))
    )
  )
);

// later...
dispatch(fetchUser('torvalds'));
</code>
</pre>

Within the period of the action triggered and the reducer works, epic middleware will get parameters and return the payload for the reducers. It is very useful when handling async/await/promise on actions and reducers.

### Typesafe Action

In addition, we can implement **typesafe-action** for create action. Here is the example.

<pre><code>
export const Increment = createAction('COUNTER/INCREMENT')<number>();
export const Decrement = createAction('COUNTER/DECREMENT')<number>();

export const InitAsync = createAsyncAction('COUNTER/INIT', 'COUNTER/INIT/SUCCESS', 
'COUNTER/INIT/FAILURE', 'COUNTER/INIT/CANCEL')<undefined, number, Error, undefined>();
</code></pre>

So we can write the code with a cleaner method when handling difficult status of a async function

<pre><code>
import { Epic, combineEpics } from 'redux-observable';
import { isActionOf } from 'typesafe-actions';
import { InitAsync } from './actions';
import { filter, map, mergeMap, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { from, of } from 'rxjs';
import { RootState, RootActions } from '..';

export const initAsyncEpic: Epic<RootActions, RootActions, RootState> = (action$, state$) =>
    
    action$.pipe(
        filter(isActionOf(InitAsync.request)),
        mergeMap(action => 
            from(of(612)).pipe(
                map(InitAsync.success),
                catchError(error => of(InitAsync.failure(error as Error)))
            )
        )
    );

export default combineEpics(
    initAsyncEpic
);
</code></pre>

### Unit test for epic middleware

I will cover this for next post.
