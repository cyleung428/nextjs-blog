Recently, I have to use **chunked encoded** HTTP response in order to optimized performance for some service.

## Simple express server with normal response
API and single HTTP response are widely used for interaction between software intermediaries. It is a common and user-friendly way for data transfer. Let's start with a simple express server for that. In <code class=" language-javascript">server.js</code>, it starts a server and listens on port 3001 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found.
<pre class=" language-javascript">
<code class=" language-javascript">
import express from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3001;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
</code>
</pre>

## What's lacking? Why chunked response?
In order to send response to the client in the traditional way, you have to buffer all the data in memory or disk before you start transmitting. Also, you have to know how large the output is going to be. Meanwhile, chunked transfer encoding allows a server to maintain an HTTP persistent connection for dynamically generated content. You don't have to generate the full content before writing to header. This could help free your memory or disk and also reduce consuming resources.

## Simple chunked encoded 
It is easy to implement chunked encoded response in express. JavaScript is a non-blocking single thread language, so we can use <code>Rxjs</code> to simulate the situation. In server.js, we now set an Rx observable for setting timeout for each response and set subscribe so that when there are next event it will write a chunked response to client. When the subscribe is completed, the response will be ended by <code class=" language-javascript">res.end</code>.
<pre class=" language-javascript">
<code class=" language-javascript">
import express from "express";
import Rx from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Rx.Observable(subscriber => {
  subscriber.next("first response");
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next("second response");
  }, 500);
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next("third response");
  }, 1000);
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next("final response");
    subscriber.complete();
  }, 2000);
});

const app = express();
const port = 3001;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  observable.subscribe({
    next(x) { res.write(x); },
    error(err) { console.error('something wrong occurred: ' + err); },
    complete() { res.end(); }
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
</code>
</pre>

## Result for the chunked response
In our client.js, we write a function so that we can get the chunked response. 
<pre class=" language-javascript">
<code class=" language-javascript">
import fetch from "node-fetch";

fetch("http://localhost:3001/")
  .then(response => response.body)
  .then(res => res.on('readable', () => {
  let chunk;
  while (null !== (chunk = res.read())) {
    console.log(chunk.toString());
  }
}))
.catch(err => console.log(err));
</code>
</pre>

As the result,
