I got an offer from **Itiviti AB** and started working as an <b>intern web developer</b> last two weeks ago. I was so excited as I could work in the largest trading software vendor among the world.

Itiviti development team applies scrum as their development process. There are hundreds of projects inside it, including trading bridge, connectivity, management dashboard, etc. I am responsible for the **Multi UL Dashboard** which provide users and profiles management. The tech stacks are the following:

- React.js
- Typescript
- Express.js
- Redux, Rxjs

Hopefully I will get a return offer after this internship! :)
